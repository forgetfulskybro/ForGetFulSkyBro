### My Bio ðŸ˜²

My name is `ForGetFulSkyBro` or you can call me `Sky` for short. I make websites and Discord bots whenever I feel bored and have nothing else to do or play. If you want to talk to me, you can find me [here](https://discord.gg/ty6Rsua)

## Current Project

My current project's name is `ForGetFul`, it's a multipurpose Discord bot made for any server to have fun for the members, logging and moderation for the moderators and/or admins, and a utility section for anyone that wants to see some statistics (like myself). I love seeing statistics, either it being the bot's stats, guilds, or even users! There is hundreds of commands to check out for yourself. You can invite it [here](https://forgetful.ga/invite), you can find its website [here](https://forgetful.ga). If you want to see all my projects I've worked on, you can find them all [here](https://forgetful.ga/about).



## Spotify Status

Well, it's kind of obvious, here you can see what I've listened to recently or I am currently. **Don't mind the weird songs if you happen to see it here, I am just weird and like listening to them ðŸ˜³**
